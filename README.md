💡 This project is aimed at creating a new clustering pipeline designed for explainability.  

💻 We use a discriminator neural network with a strong sparsity criterion to dynamically select a subset of important features per student.  

📊 We then experiment with clustering on this truncated set and examine the interpretability of the clusters.
